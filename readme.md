GetTogether

The application front end is developed using ReactJS and for the voice assistant, Alexa has been used. The back-end is connected to both the front end and Alexa. Whenever a user requests an event or wants to publish it is connected to a server hosted on AWS instance. Even now it is hosted live so that anyone who wants to try can use it. It uses MongoDB to store the currently active events, user details, etc. Once the user requests something it scans through the database based on the user's location and deliver events happening near him. Created several REST APIs on the server that serves the requests.
